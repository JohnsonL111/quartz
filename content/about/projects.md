## InvolveMINT
![involveMINT](../posts/attachments/involvemint.png)

As part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.developforgood.org/">Develop For Good</a> Winter 2024 cohort I am working in a team of 7 devs to migrate InvolveMINT's backend API functionality from NestJS into C#/.NET including the data access layer from TypeORM to Entity Framework. This way the non-profit improves site security and long term scalability by moving away from the sunsetted open source framework <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jczacharia/orcha">OrchaJS</a> that dominates the backend.

Stack: C#/.NET, Angular, NestJS, Typescript, Docker, Entity Framework (EF6), Firebase (Auth/Firestore), PostgreSQL, Git

<center> Mid-animation landing page </center> <br>

Worked in a team of 4 during NWHacks 2023 to develop a full-stack web-application to fight against FOMO where users can subscribe to one another or a location and be notified when that user moves locations or when any user moves to a subscribed location. Inspired by snapchat's location tracking feature, but without the data collection.

Stack: Java, Spring Boot, React.js, CockroachDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Twilio API, Axios, Postman

For my Intro to Software Engineering Class I worked in a team of 4 in an agile scrum format to build an android app to help parents cope with having children. The app allows for CRUD on children and on task assignment (start 'em early), a coin flip feature to arbitrate decisions, a timeout feature, and breathing exercises based off a state machine.

Stack: Java, Android Studio, SharedPreferences, Git

## Space Oddysey

My friends and I decided to build a space exploration site at our first hackathon: SOSY's Hackademia. This was back before we even knew how to code (heck, we used google docs as version control). It's a pretty simple site with fun facts, a space quiz, and a space visualizer.

Stack: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery
