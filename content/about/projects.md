## InvolveMINT
![involveMINT](../posts/attachments/involvemint.png)

As part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.developforgood.org/">Develop For Good</a> Winter 2024 cohort I am working in a team of 7 devs to migrate InvolveMINT's backend API functionality from NestJS into C#/.NET including the data access layer to Entity Framework. This way the non-profit can improve site security and long term scalability by moving away from sunsetted open source packages such as  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jczacharia/orcha">OrchaJS</a>.

Stack: C#/.NET, Angular, NestJS, Typescript, Docker, Entity Framework (EF6), Firebase (Auth/Firestore), PostgreSQL, Git

Worked in a team of 4 during NWHacks 2023 to develop a full-stack web-application to fight against FOMO where users can subscribe to one another or a location and be notified when that user moves locations or when any user moves to a subscribed location. Inspired by snapchat's location tracking feature, but without the data collection.

Stack: Java, Spring, React.js, CockroachDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Twilio API, Axios, Postman
