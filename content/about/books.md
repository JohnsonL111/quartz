Books are a great past-time. Though, I'm fairly on and off with reading. I hope to be more consistent in the future. Nowadays; however, when I do I read I tend to gravitate towards books related to productivity, leadership, and self-book. In the past (aka in high school) I enjoyed reading mainly YA Fantasy novels.

## The "To-Complete" Bookshelf
Book series that I've touched in the past, but have since abruptly stopped for one reason or another. I intend to circle back to, someday, completing these series. <br>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/165484-wayward-children" target="_blank">The Wayward Children Series by Seanan McGuire</a> <br>
> ***Where I left off***: I completed book 4 (In an absent dream) back in mid-2022. This series, as a whole, comprises of short and sweet portal fantasy novellas. That way, they aren't too big of a commitment to dive into. Apparently, the **9th** entry to the series is set to release in 2024 - where has time gone?! <br>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/199547-the-book-of-dust" target="_blank">The Book of Dust Series by Philip Pullman</a> <br>
> ***Where I left off***: I completed book 1 (La Belle Sauvage) back in 2020. The first entry of the series was an excellent science fiction adventure novel. Unfortunately, I probably borrowed The Secret Commonwealth (book 2) like 3 times already. Each time I end up dropping it because of school (not because it was bad or anything). Surely it's time to complete this duology once and for all. <br>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/131836-six-of-crows" target="_blank">Six of Crows Series by Leigh Bardugo </a> <br>
> ***Where I left off***: I completed book 1 (Six of Crows) back in 2017. Speaking of duologies this is another one of such series that I should wrap up. Heck, it's been almost 7 years. <br>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/191449-the-conqueror-s-saga" target="_blank">The Conqueror's Saga Series by Keirsten White </a> <br>
> ***Where I left off***: I completed book 2 (Now I Rise) back in 2017. This is a great historical fiction series with some of the quirkiest cast of characters. <br>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/68150-falling-kingdoms" target="_blank">Falling Kingdoms Series by Morgan Rhodes </a> <br>
> ***Where I left off***: I completed book 5 (Crystal Storm) back in 2018. This series was my intro to high fantasy and got me interested in other high fantasy authors like Brandon Sanderson. <br>
