Oh boy, first post and it's for an absolutely crazy semester. Alright, *ahem*, let's do this.

After arriving back from the depths of my coop at [Powerex](https://powerex.com/) trust me when I say that I was not looking forward to returning to school. Not only was I enjoying the free coffee and soft drinks at the companies downtown office ***a bit*** too much, but it's also a uniquely relaxing feeling to not have to worry about classes.

So I seeked for another coop this semester.

Along with seeking I also enrolled in four courses:
- <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2023/fall/cmpt/307/d100" target="_blank">CMPT 307 - Data Structures and Algorithms II </a>
- <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2023/fall/cmpt/371/d100" target="_blank">CMPT 371 - Data Communications and Networking </a>
- <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2023/fall/cmpt/376w/d100" target="_blank">CMPT 376W - Professional Responsibility and Technical Writing </a>
- <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2023/fall/phil/203/d100" target="_blank">PHIL 203 - Metaphysics </a>

## The market shows its true colors

Some rapid-fire stats for this seeking semester:
- 91 applications
- 4 OAs
- 7 interviews
- 1 offer
- 45 LC problems sprinkled through the semester

I mainly applied to SWE/SDE roles and targeted medium/larger companies and/or companies with 4 month positions. This seeking semester was particularly rough due to market conditions.

I soon, among other invites, received a SWE interview invite for ATPCO and I was pretty excited. I quickly gave my interview availability on the day of the invitation and prepped for the interview. I received radio silence for a week and a half, so I followed up. Turns out they hired someone internally. A great way to start the seeking term.

Fast forward to mid-way through the semester I was getting quite disheartened after so far fumbling the bag with interviews for a SDE role at SAP and at two SWE roles for Copperleaf. This combined with midterms made me frusturated and stressed. I did not think I would be able to land a coop this semester, but I kept going.

Determined, I attended the CSSS Tech Fair and printed copies of my resume to hand out. Particularly, I talked to one of the boothers at motorola who happened to be an SFU coop student. We traded linkedin connections and he talked about his previous coop at PaybyPhone. Funny enough, the day after I received an interview invite for a SWE role at PayByPhone. I would like to mention that I also dm'd my resume to the recruiter of this position on linkedin and she seemed happy to receive it which may or may not have played a role in receiving the interview. Anyways, I quickly reached out to the SFU coop student and he shared some advice about the interview process. With this information, I went to work on prepping.

The day before the interview I was getting a bit worried. I've received no follow-ups after sending in my availability the week before. I don't know who's interviewing me and the day of the 1st possible interview slot was coming up. Surely this wasn't an ATPCO rerun.

Unfortunately, I soon received the dreaded email that the position was cancelled. Back to the drawing board.

It did not take until the last week of school and a week before finals to receive my next interview invite and at this point I was innundated by final projects and exam prep. It was at ICBC for an SDE role. This was a role I applied to months before and I completely forgot I applied to it. On one hand I was relieved to have one more chance, but on the other hand I was freaking tired of this semester. Particularly, CMPT 307 (algorithms II) was railing me to no tomorrow with me trying to wrap my head around dynamic programming and greedy paradigm problems.

Nevertheless, I put forth my best foot. I found the current coop in that role on linkedin and funny enough it happened to be someone who was a [DFG](https://www.developforgood.org/) alumni. I asked a bit about his time at the company and the interview process and also about his experience at DFG. We had a nice chat and I then prepped for the interview fingers crossed that the role wouldn't be cancelled.

I think the interview went well. I liked the interviewers and it was a nice conversation. They said they would contact me the day after since they had a few more interviews to conduct. I kept refreshing my email the day after instead of studying and I got dopamine spikes from the ding of a new email seeping its way into my sfu inbox. Some emails were literally rejection emails from other roles that I applied to, *sigh*. 

I then received the coveted email from ICBC for the offer. Some stress lifted at that moment knowing that I didn't need to continuing seeking this semester because at this point the market was so dry it was like debugging code in a desert â€“ searching for a missing semicolon in a sandbox of code (yeah, I stole this from chatgpt). I quickly accepted the offer, of course.

## CMPT 307 - is this a CMPT or a MATH class?

I knew this was going to be a tough course and I made sure to enroll in it with all my friends so we could suffer together. I took it with Brad Bart who had some interesting [RMP](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/20266) reviews such as this incredible megamind of a comment.

Maybe I have terrible english comprehension because I still don't know what the reviewer is trying to say, but it's probably very insightful as per its solid 3 upvotes.
