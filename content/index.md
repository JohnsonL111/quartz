Hello! I'm Johnson. I am currently studying [Computer Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) and minoring in [Philosophy](https://www.sfu.ca/philosophy.html) at Simon Fraser University.

I am a curious software developer/amateur philosopher who enjoys learning about full-stack development, productivity, and philosophy.

- [Books](about/books.md) I have read and find interesting enough to write about;
- [Projects](about/projects.md) that I (and my teammates) have built;
